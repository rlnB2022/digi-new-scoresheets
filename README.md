# DIGITAL DUGOUT

https://digidugout.com

This website was created for a specific gaming niche, Tabletop Baseball Gaming.  These games use baseball player cards and dice. Games like Strat-O-matic, APBA, Payoff Pitch, etc. all fit into this category. They also all have the same exact issue which is the immense amount of time that it takes to set the game up. This is where I got the idea to create DigiDugout.com.

## Features

* mySQL database with tables for all players that have ever played the game along with the lineups for each game ever played
* Custom calendar with month and year selectors.
* Team names displayed with color-coded background and fonts.
* View, at a glance, the real-life winning and losing pitchers as well as who earned the save. Also displays the runs, hits and errors.
* View the lineups for each team
* Print the scoresheet will popup a pdf file for printing.
* Lineups and starting pitchers are pre-filled

## Development Process

My goal was simple. Create a website where users don't have to do any online research; they don't have to write the lineups and starting pitchers on a blank scorehseet by hand; they can just literally find the game and click print.

I knew what I wanted to build. I knew who my audience was and why they would want to use this resource. I just didn't know what Tech to use to accomplish my goals.

So, I did some research. Mainly into how to access a database from a website that I would create. I stumbled across some YouTube videos on PHP that showed how to connect, read, update, and delete data. It seemed fairly simple so I moved forward.

Next, I looked into web-hosting and found that there were cheap hosting services that used myPhpAdmin, so I went with it. From that point forward, I was learning PHP "on-the-job". I used php.net/docs often, as well as StackOverflow and standard Google searched to find what I was looking for.

## Wireframes and Designs

I went through a number of iterations on the design for the website before settling on the current version. I really just wanted the website to be simple to use and straight to the point. I used simple lined-notebooks and blank sheets of copy paper to draw out ideas. It wasn't until many months later that I discovered Figma, but never used on this project.

## Development

To keep track of my progress and what was left to be done, I used a combination of Trello and index cards that I would write on. The index cards turned out to be a not-so-great idea as they would often fall off my desk and into the trash, or get mixed in with other papers, which just drove me crazy. 

Throughout the development process, I continued to learn not only about PHP, but jQuery and AJAX. I learned that they go hand-in-hand and that allowed me to fetch data without reloading the page. I thought that was so cool!

## Post Launch Support

I have received a handful of requests to fix bugs and introduce changes based on customer feedback.

## What I Have Learned

In the beginning, I struggled to get things to work as intended as I was completely new to PHP, AJAX and jQuery. It took a monumental effort to learn these technologies during the development process.

I learned a lot with this project. New tech, new methods of fetching data, and I even learned that if you don't like the way built-in Date Objects work, I can make my own.

I'm certain the code can be improved upon, but I'm super proud of the work I did on this!
