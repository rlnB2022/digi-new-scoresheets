# DIGITAL DUGOUT

https://digidugout.com

This website was created for a specific gaming niche, Tabletop Baseball Gaming.  These games use baseball player cards and dice. Games like Strat-O-matic, APBA, Payoff Pitch, etc. all fit into this category. They also all have the same exact issue which is the immense amount of time that it takes to set the game up. This is where I got the idea to create DigiDugout.com.
