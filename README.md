# DIGITAL DUGOUT

https://digidugout.com

This website was created for a specific gaming niche, Tabletop Baseball Gaming.  These games use baseball player cards and dice. Games like Strat-O-matic, APBA, Payoff Pitch, etc. all fit into this category. They also all have the same exact issue which is the immense amount of time that it takes to set the game up. This is where I got the idea to create DigiDugout.com.

## Development Process

My goal was simple. Create a website where users don't have to do any online research; they don't have to write the lineups and starting pitchers on a blank scorehseet by hand; they can just literally find the game and click print.

I knew what I wanted to build. I knew who my audience was and why they would want to use this resource. I just didn't know what Tech to use to accomplish my goals.

So, I did some research. Mainly into how to access a database from a website that I would create. I stumbled across some YouTube videos on PHP that showed how to connect, read, update, and delete data. It seemed fairly simple so I moved forward.

Next, I looked into web-hosting and found that there were cheap hosting services that used myPhpAdmin, so I went with it. From that point forward, I was learning PHP "on-the-job". I used php.net/docs often, as well as StackOverflow and standard Google searched to find what I was looking for.
